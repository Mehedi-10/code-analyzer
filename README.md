# AI Assistant

This project aims to develop an AI assistant that can help with problem summarization and topic suggestion based on problem statements.

## Project Structure

The project has the following structure:

```
- preprocessing.py
- train.py
- assistant.py
- utils.py
- requirements.txt
```

- `preprocessing.py`: Code for preprocessing the dataset.
- `train.py`: Code for training the AI assistant.
- `assistant.py`: Code for implementing the AI assistant's functionalities.
- `utils.py`: Code containing utility functions.
- `requirements.txt`: File listing the required Python packages.

## Usage

1. Install the required packages by running the following command:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Prepare your dataset of problem statements and suggested topics.

3. Run the preprocessing step to clean and preprocess the dataset:
   ```
   python preprocessing.py
   ```

4. Train the AI assistant using the preprocessed data:
   ```
   python train.py
   ```

5. Run the AI assistant to generate problem summaries and suggest topics:
   ```
   python assistant.py
   ```
